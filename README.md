quickshell
==========

A python module to work with files and the clipboard. Clipboard-related functions work only in Windows. Everything else is cross-platform.

Quickshell is designed to be used primarily from within a python REPL. Therefore all functions names are as short as possible.

###What all can I do with it?###

The most useful things are:

* List the contents of a directory.
* Apply a transform (a lambda to a file).
* Apply a transform to text on clipboard. Is often useful while editing code.
